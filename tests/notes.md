+ Testing Constants - check for expected values of constants for testing
+ Angle/number parameter - check that passing equalsX angles or numbers works
+ Inequality - check for each property that changing it affets assertion
+ Unexpected type for equalsX - check that unexpected types passed to expect affects the assertion
+ Expected type for equals - check that x.equals is true and false with expected types
+ Unexpected type for equals - check that x.equals is false with unexpected types


toString
--------


thrownErrors
------------
